# Agent Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Do NOT maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly requested by the user.** Break things boldly. Clean refactoring over legacy support.

**TARGET: Keep total instructions under 20-30 lines.** Every instruction competes for the agent's limited instruction budget (~150-200 total). Be ruthless about what stays.

## Project Overview

<!-- Update this section as the project takes shape -->

**Project type:** [To be determined - e.g., web app, CLI tool, library]  
**Primary language:** [To be determined]  
**Key dependencies:** [To be determined]

## Commands

<!-- Update these as your workflow evolves - commands change frequently -->

```bash
# Development
# [Add your dev server command here]

# Testing
# [Add your test command here]

# Build
# [Add your build command here]
```

---

## Code Conventions

<!-- Keep this minimal - let tools like linters handle formatting -->

- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- Prefer explicit over clever
- Delete dead code immediately

---

## Architecture

<!-- Major architecture changes MUST trigger a rewrite of this section -->

```
[Add directory structure overview when it stabilizes]
```

## Maintenance Notes

**Keep this file lean and current:**

1. **Remove placeholder sections** once you fill them in
2. **Review regularly** - stale instructions poison the agent's context
3. **CRITICAL: Keep total under 20-30 lines** - move detailed docs to separate files and reference them
4. **Update commands immediately** when workflows change
5. **Rewrite Architecture section** when major architectural changes occur
6. **Delete anything the agent can infer** from your code

**Remember:** Coding agents learn from your actual code. Only document what's truly non-obvious or critically important.
